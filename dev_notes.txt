This is a list of all changes I make to the game script and why.

1, Rival's team composition has changed.  He will have a completely different team depending on your starter and his team will grow organically to meet the needs of his team, based on what he could have caught at that point.
2, Pewter City.  The guy doesn't walk you to the gym because I'm lazy.
3, Route 24.  Added a level 20 Arbok to the Rocket's team at the end of the bridge.  I want Team Rocket to be less of a joke, since they are actually working behind the scenes to try to save the world and you keep ruining their plans because you're awesome.  Unless you've already faced Misty, this will be the biggest, scariest thing you've fought so far.  It flows much better with him trying to recruit you by force and then having a big, powerful pokemon, than the original where he just has a level 15 Ekans and a level 15 Zubat.  Also, Arboks don't naturally occur until level 23, but you have to remember that this guy is a major recruiter, so he's good at nurturing talent.
4, Cerulean City.  Guy who explains what badges do instead tells you that they don't do anything, because I've removed all benefits and badge restrictions from the game.  Gym leaders also don't talk about benefits of badges, because there aren't any anymore.
5, Sailor who says that his father said that there are 100 kinds of pokemon increased to 1000, to better reflect how many pokemon there actually are in this game.
6, Rival's team on S.S. Anne dramatically increased in power.  The S.S. Anne functions very much like a dungeon and it's only fitting for it to have a boss.  Also, I want him to feel like an actual rival who could become the champion, instead of some snotty kid.
7, Dramatically increased the power of Surge's team.  He now has 2 level 22 Voltorbs that both know Selfdestruct.  This is to show the player that there are reasons to not lead with your sweeper.  Then he has a level 24 Electabuzz, which only knows GROWL, LEER, THUNDERSHOCK, and RAGE, but he has a very high stat block for this level.  Then he has a level 27 Bulbachu to deal with RAZOR LEAF, SWIFT, THUNDERSHOCK, and THUNDER WAVE to deal with you inevitably bring a type ground to the party.  Then he has a level 28 Raichu that knows SWIFT, BODY SLAM, THUNDERBOLT, and SUBMISSION, because fuck you.
8, Made the guy on the couch in Lavender Town Pokemon Center reference Cu- Pokemon, because all of them wear skulls.
9, Slightly changed dialog in Lavender Town to provide more context on the background story.  Added note about how I changed X [stat] items to clear debuffs in addition to buffing.
10, Drastically changed trainer battles in Lavender Tower.
11, Replaced some dialog that talked about trading in Celadon City, because trading isn't in Fusion, aside from NPC interactions.
12, Added NPC in Celadon Department Store who warns you that using an element stone causes most pokemon stop learning moves.
13, Added MOON STONE and TRADE STONE to Celadon Department Store.  Since there are more than 4 pokemon in the game that require a MOON STONE to reach their final form, MOON STONEs are now infinite.
14, Removed advice to trade with friends from the Celadon Mansion.
15, Revamped prize exchange to actually be useful.
16, Changed some dialog to support the fan-theory that Team Rocket is desperately trying to stop Mewtwo.
17, Changed Giovanni's team significantly.  He has a Rhyhorn that knows HORN ATTACK, STOMP, ROCK SLIDE, DIG, a Kangaskhan that knows RAGE, BODY SLAM, COMET PUNCH, BITE, a Machamp-Sandslash that knows SLASH, LOW KICK, FOCUS ENERGY, EARTHQUAKE, a Nidoqueen that knows BODY SLAM, EARTHQUAKE, ICE BEAM, POISON STING, and a Dugtrio-Cloyster that knows EARTHQUAKE, CLAMP, SAND ATTACK, ICE BEAM.
18, Changed Erika's team.  She now has a Golem-Vileplume that knows MEGA DRAIN, EXPLOSION, EARTHQUAKE, and ROCK SLIDE, a Victreebell-Ninetales that knows CONFUSE RAY, FIRE BLAST, ACID, and MEGA DRAIN, an Exeggutor that knows STOMP, PSYCHIC, MEGA DRAIN, and EXPLOSION, a Parasect that knows SPORE, SLASH, STUN SPORE, and DIG, and a Venusaur that knows RAZOR LEAF, MEGA DRAIN, BODY SLAM, and VINE WHIP.  This is the 4th gym, so it's time to start having the gym leaders have completely balanced teams that still keep to the theme.  This should also be an interesting fight, because the AI has to manage 2 team members that have x4 vulnerabilities.
19, Changed dialog to indicate that two of the Dojo Master's team members are now ghost types after being attacked by Sabrina.
20, Dramatically changed Fighting Dojo, but still left them with a significant vulnerability to psychic.
21, Adjusted placement of stairs and elevator for a more coherent Silph Co.
22, Kept with the above theme for Giovanni's team, but improved it appropriately.  He has a Rhydon that knows BODY SLAM, HORN DRILL, ROCK SLIDE, and EARTHQUAKE, a Kangaskhan that knows RAGE, BODY SLAM, DIZZY PUNCH, and BITE, a Jolteon-Sandslash that knows SLASH, THUNDERBOLT, EARTHQUAKE, and BODY SLAM, a Machamp-Sandslash that knows SLASH, SUBMISSION, FOCUS ENERGY, and EARTHQUAKE, a NIDOQUEEN that knows BODY SLAM, EARTHQUAKE, ICE BEAM, and THUNDERBOLT, and a Dugtrio-Cloyster that knows EARTHQUAKE, CLAMP, SAND ATTACK, and BLIZZARD.
23, I don't know exactly what triggers opening up the Viridian City Gym, but it isn't beating Giovanni in Silph.  I have made beating Giovanni in Silph the trigger for opening up that gym.  That gym is more or less impossible at that point, but if you really set your mind to beating Giovanni 3 times in a row with no other activities, I won't stop you.
24, The second fight with Giovanni may be a bit of a let-down in terms of difficulty.  Thus far, all boss fights have been scaled to be "harrowing."  If you fight every single trainer in Silph, you will face him on more or less even terms.  This is because there are 31 trainer fights in Silph before Giovanni and only 3 of them are required.  A balance had to be struck in terms of difficulty and not requiring you to face everyone.
25, Changed.  She is a rare gym leader in that she uses no fusions and sticks to the gen1 psychics.  She has a Hypno that knows HYPNOSIS, DREAM EATER, BODY SLAM, and SEISMIC TOSS.  I wanted something to show you how powerful Dream Eater is, so it doesn't know Psychic.  She has a Jynx that knows PSYCHIC, BLIZZARD, BODY SLAM, and LOVELY KISS, which is the optimum layout of Jynx.  She has a Starmie that knows HYDROPUMP, RECOVER, SWIFT, and PSYCHIC, which is both a reminder to the full potential of Starmie and a really powerful setup.  It also hard-counters Golem-Beedrill, which is the best anti-psychic pokemon in the game.  She has an Exeggutor that knows SOLAR BEAM, PSYCHIC, HYPNOSIS, and EXPLOSION.  I didn't want to reuse it from the grass gym, but Exeggutor is too powerful to not use.  Lastly, she has an Alakazam that knows PSYCHIC, RECOVER, COUNTER, and SUBSTITUTE, because of course she does.  I made sure that a significant portion of her party can disable you with status effects, because that always felt more appropriate to the Psychic type, instead of just going for DPS.
26, Safari Zone is normal combat with no step limit, though costs more to get in.  I never met anyone who liked the Safari Zone minigame and I met a lot of people who hated it, so I'm just not implementing it.
27, Changed Koga's team.  He leads with a Wheezing that knows EXPLOSION, TOXIC, THUNDERBOLT, and FIRE BLAST, because you've probably been underestimating those things.  He has a Golbat that knows TOXIC, CONFUSE RAY, MEGA DRAIN, and WING ATTACK and is surrisingly effective at dismantling opponents.  I want players to know that seemingly jank pokemon actually do have potential.  He has a Venomoth that knows TOXIC, SLEEP POWDER, STUN SPORE, and PSYCHIC, which should try to lock you down and toxic you, but may opt for blasting.  He then has an Arbok that knows TOXIC, WRAP, BITE, and ACID, but that's really just there for the Toxic-Wrap combo.  He has a Slowbro-Tentacruel that knows TOXIC, WRAP, AMNESIA, and HYDROPUMP which has the Toxic-Wrap combo, but is also there to blast Ground types to bits.  Lastly, he has a Muk that knows TOXIC, BODY SLAM, FIRE BLAST, EXPLOSION.
