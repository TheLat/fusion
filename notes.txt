TO FIX:
Brock with a Geodude that only knows Spore and Dream Eater never uses Spore.
Opening Scene
Correctly set up default OSX keybinds.
Random seed
Make Oak's Cloynite know Rage instead of Body Slam.
Potion in storage on new game.
Slots
Escape Rope should only be a dig effect.
Sound bug, mutes not clearing after a cry, mute/unmute music code
