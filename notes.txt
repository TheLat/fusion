TO FIX:
Crash bugs in capturing Nido-fusions west of Viridian?
Make bonk sound non-blocking
Don't take keyboard input when not in focus (windows only)
Crash bug related to leveling up and capturing?
Speed-up button?
Move queue not cleared at start of fight
Absorb works on underground Pokemon
Crash on smart trainers.  Maybe fixed?
