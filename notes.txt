Professor Oak's team:
Poliwrath-Chansey that knows MINIMIZE, AMNESIA, SOFTBOILED, and HYPER BEAM
Hypno-Parasect that knows SPORE, DREAM EATER, PSYCHIC, and DIG
Golem-Beedrill that knows EARTHQUAKE, EXPLOSION, PIN MISSILE, and ROCK SLIDE
Cloyster-Dragonite that knows BODY SLAM, SUPERSONIC, ICE BEAM, and HYPER BEAM
Jynx-Gengar that knows LOVELY KISS, DREAM EATER, BODY SLAM, and BLIZZARD
Magmar-Golem that knows ROCK SLIDE, FIRE PUNCH, EXPLOSION, and EARTHQUAKE

TO FIX:
Sound bugs, clear all mutes when playing a sound.
Blend cries are quiet.
Brock with a Geodude that only knows Spore and Dream Eater never uses Spore.
