This is a reimplementation of Pokemon Red and Blue, but with the implementation of the idea presented at this website:  http://pokemon.alexonsager.net/

This work is not done with his permission.

This is intended to be a hobby project and will never be released.

The game is more or less the same as Pokemon Red and Blue, but with changes made so that it is technically possible to capture all 22,801 pokemon.  God help you if you try.  The game is built with data pulled from BULBAPEDIA.

If you want to get into the raw data, it is all stored in plain text format in the resoures/data directory.  You can alter this, if you want.  Stability cannot be guaranteed if you do.  The basic idea behind the fusions is that it's half of each pokemon slammed together.  The stats are the average of the two parents.  The moveset will be every odd move from the first parent and every even move from the second parent, unless the developer has deliberately altered the data.  The types of the fusion will be the first type of each parent.  If those are the same, it will use the second type of the second parent, if it exists.  To deal with the possibility of a fusion never learning a damage-dealing move, a fusion will be able to learn every move from a TM or HM that either of its parents could learn.

Bugs in Pokemon Red and Blue will be fixed, such as the fact that Focus Energy would divide your critical chance by 4 instead of multiplying it.

The developer of this game wishes to remain anonymous and will not answer any questions.  If, for some reason, people want to contribute art assets, the developer may take them and include them in the game.  Credits to the game will be the original Pokemon Red and Blue credits.

List of changes:
- Fusion machine in Professor Oak's Lab.
- Any story event that asks you to choose between pokemon that can't be found in the wild (the fossils, Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, etc.) will grant you all the pokemon instead.  This does not apply to the starter pokemon at the beginning.
- Beating the Elite 4 will give you the option of getting more money or another pick from the starter pokemon.
- The Elite 4 will allow you to challenge them in Hardcore Mode, where all of their pokemon have leveled up once for every time you've beaten them.
- TMs will be rechargeable instead of one-shots.  Not sure where to put the TM recharger yet.
- Critical hit chance will be done on an individual attack basis for multi-attacks
- Focus Energy will multiply your critical chance by 4 instead of dividing it by 4.
- You will be able to explore the S.S. Anne area after the boat leaves and you will be able to push the truck to get Mew.  I am unsure of the validity of this in the original game, but it seems as good a place as any to let you get Mew.
- Pokemon that can be found in the wild are a combination of everything you could find in Red or Blue, along with all possible fusions of those.
- The Safari Zone will be normal combat.  That area was bullshit.
- To deal with the fact that this game is not multiplayer, the Trade Stone item is added to allow you to evolve anything that contains at least part Kadabra, Machoke, Haunter, or Graveler.  You will need two trade stones to fully evolve fusions of those 4.
- Ghost attacks will deal double-damage against psychics, like they're supposed to.
- Item duplication and MISSINGNO will not exist.  Use that master ball carefully.
- TMs and HMs will be forgettable.
- Minor move balancing.

Concerning Fusions:
There are 22,801 pokemon that can appear in Pokemon: Fusion.  The developer can't inspect all of them.  Some may be duds with few or no attack moves (Pikachu-Bulbasaur is quite terrible).  Some things may happen that make no sense (things fused with Gengar will learn Hypnosis from Gengar or Dream Eater from Gengar, but not both).  As a way to balance this, fusions are compatible with every TM and HM that either parent could learn.
