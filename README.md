This is a reimplementation of Pokemon Red and Blue, but with the implementation of the idea presented at this website:  http://pokemon.alexonsager.net/

This work is not done with his permission.

This is intended to be a hobby project and will never be released.

The game is more or less the same as Pokemon Red and Blue, but with changes made so that it is technically possible to capture all 22,801 pokemon.  God help you if you try.  The game is built with data pulled from BULBAPEDIA.

If you want to get into the raw data, it is all stored in plain text format in the resoures/data directory.  You can alter this, if you want.  Stability cannot be guaranteed if you do.  The basic idea behind the fusions is that it's half of each pokemon slammed together.  The stats are the average of the two parents.  The moveset will be every odd move from the first parent and every even move from the second parent, unless the developer has deliberately altered the data.  The types of the fusion will be the first type of each parent.  If those are the same, it will use the second type of the second parent, if it exists.  To deal with the possibility of a fusion never learning a damage-dealing move, a fusion will be able to learn every move from a TM or HM that either of its parents could learn.

Bugs in Pokemon Red and Blue will be fixed, such as the fact that Focus Energy would divide your critical chance by 4 instead of multiplying it.

The developer of this game wishes to remain anonymous and will not answer any questions.  If, for some reason, people want to contribute art assets, the developer may take them and include them in the game.  Credits to the game will be the original Pokemon Red and Blue credits.
